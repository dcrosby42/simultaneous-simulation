These graphics were borrowed from the awesome crossfire project: [http://crossfire.real-time.com/](http://crossfire.real-time.com/)

I pulled them from here: [http://sourceforge.net/p/crossfire/code/HEAD/tree/arch/trunk/](http://sourceforge.net/p/crossfire/code/HEAD/tree/arch/trunk/)

I believe their license is GPL as specified here: [http://crossfire.real-time.com/license/gpl.html](http://crossfire.real-time.com/license/gpl.html)

I also put a copy of the GPL license in `gpl.txt` the current directory.
