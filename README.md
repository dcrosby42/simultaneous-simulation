Do a:

    bundle install

Then you should be able to start a server from the examples directory by doing:

    ruby server.rb

and then you can start some clients with:

    ruby client.rb


This won't work with the current renet gem on rubygems, you'll need to install the latest version from here: [https://github.com/Dahrkael/rENet](https://github.com/Dahrkael/rENet)
